PreProcLib: Simplified Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning and Deep Learning üõ†Ô∏èüß†

PreProcLib is an open-source Python library designed to streamline the data preprocessing workflow for machine learning and deep learning applications. The library simplifies the preprocessing of diverse data types, including audio, video, text, tabular, and image data. It aims to reduce the need for procedural code and minimize boilerplate code when dealing with large-scale data preprocessing tasks.

Features

Diverse Data Support: PreProcLib supports various data types, enabling users to preprocess audio, video, text, tabular, and image data effortlessly.

Code Simplification: With PreProcLib, you can perform complex preprocessing operations with minimal code. The library abstracts away procedural details, making it easy to preprocess data without extensive coding efforts.

Bulk Data Processing: PreProcLib facilitates bulk preprocessing of data, allowing you to efficiently handle large datasets without the need for verbose code.

Python Implementation: Implemented in Python, PreProcLib integrates seamlessly with popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks, making it a versatile tool for data scientists and developers.

Installation

Install PreProcLib using pip:

pip install preproclib

from preproclib import preprocess

# Example usage for audio data
audio_data = ...  # Your audio data
preprocessed_audio = preprocess.audio(audio_data)

# Example usage for text data
text_data = "... your input text ..."
preprocessed_text = preprocess.text(text_data)

# Example usage for image data
image_data = ...  # Your image data
preprocessed_image = preprocess.image(image_data)

# ... and similarly for video and tabular data
